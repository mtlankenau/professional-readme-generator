## Installation
In order to successfully use this project, the user must have Node.js installed on their machine.  This will give the user access to a number of Node's modules, most importantly 'file system' and 'inquirer'.  Before installing inquirer, the user should create a 'package.json' file in their root directory by typing 'npm init' in the command line terminal. Also, the user should create a .gitignore file in their root directory and add 'node_modules' and '.DS_Store' to the file.  Then, the user should install inquirer to their project by typing 'npm install inquirer' in the command line terminal.  This will add inquirer as a dependency within the 'package.json' file, create a 'package-lock.json file', and create the ignored 'node_modules' folder.

## Usage
This project is intended to be used as a easy-to-use formatted structure for creating professional quality README files for any past, present, or future projects.  When run, by typing 'node index.js' into the command line terminal, the user will answer the questions/prompts and then a README file will be automatically written to the root project directory, ready to be pushed to the appropriate GitHub repository.
